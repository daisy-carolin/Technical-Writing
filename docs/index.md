Documentation Tools
Documentation in software engineering is the umbrella term that encompasses all written documents and materials dealing with a software product’s development and use.

User Documentation

• How-to guides – Guides the user to complete a task or a predetermined goal.
• Tutorials – Learns a concept by following a series of steps concept
• Reference docs – Describes the technical detail of the product (Software requirement specification, software design documents and so on)
• Administration Guide: Enables the administrator to refer to this after installing an application
• Configuration Guide: Allows the administrator to refer to this document for configuration parameters.
Developer Documentation
This documentation refers to system-related documentation.
• API documentation –Specifies how to invoke API calls and classes, or how to include API in the code that is being developed.
• Release notes: Describes about the latest software, feature releases, and what bugs have been fixed. Usually, this document is a text file with a filename extension (.txt).
• README: A form of documentation, it is usually a simple plain text file called Read Me, READ.ME, README.TXT with A high-level overview of the software, usually alongside the source code.
• System documentation – Describes the system requirements, includes design documents and UML diagrams.
3. Software Documentation Tool: GitHub
GitHub pages let you convert your GitHub repositories and documents into a visually appealing website to showcase your portfolio, documentation, or your projects easily. GitHub pages provide you with one free webpage, GitHub hosting, and the ability to route a custom domain. Use Jekyll (a tool that converts plain text files into websites) and easily create an elegant web page.
4. Software Documentation Tool: MarkdownPad

5. Software Documentation Tool: Read the DocsRead the Docs is a free platform for software documentation, used by millions of developers worldwide. Read the Docs simplifies software documentation by automating the building, versioning, and hosting of your docs for you. Read the Docs hosts your software documentation for free and currently supports over 90,000 projects.
6. Software Documentation Tool: Doxygen

Doxygen directly extracts the documentation from the sources, making it easier to keep the documentation consistent with the source code. Users can then export the documentation in RTF (MS-Word), PostScript, hyperlinked PDF, compressed HTML, and Unix man pages. Users can even generate graphs and diagrams from the source code, making it a highly customizable and feature-rich tool.
Question 2:Define Mkdocs
mkdocs-is a simple site generator that can create a website from a directory of markdown files. 
It’s easy to extend through 1) themes, 2) plugins, and 3) extensions to the markdown language. 
It uses simple markdown files, you can write docs in your IDE and use your normal git workflow. That keeps your code in sync with your docs, which definitely beats sending around lots of report_final22.docx files via email!
