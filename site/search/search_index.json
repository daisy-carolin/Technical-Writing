User Documentation This document is mostly delivered for end-user who actually want use the product themselves, to understand and complete a certain task. \u2022 How-to guides \u2013 Guides the user to complete a task or a predetermined goal. \u2022 Tutorials \u2013 Learns a concept by following a series of steps concept \u2022 Reference docs \u2013 Describes the technical detail of the product (Software requirement specification, software design documents and so on) \u2022 Administration Guide: Enables the administrator to refer to this after installing an application \u2022 Configuration Guide: Allows the administrator to refer to this document for configuration parameters. Developer Documentation This documentation refers to system-related documentation. \u2022 API documentation \u2013Specifies how to invoke API calls and classes, or how to include API in the code that is being developed. \u2022 Release notes: Describes about the latest software, feature releases, and what bugs have been fixed. Usually, this document is a text file with a filename extension (.txt). \u2022 README: A form of documentation, it is usually a simple plain text file called Read Me, READ.ME, README.TXT with A high-level overview of the software, usually alongside the source code. \u2022 System documentation \u2013 Describes the system requirements, includes design documents and UML diagrams. 3.
